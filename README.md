## Notes

- data/leveling.csv from [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4snrnu/lv22_player_giving_small_tips_of_advice_also/) and started from [this formatted comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4snrnu/lv22_player_giving_small_tips_of_advice_also/d5avgx1) in particular
- data/combat.csv is from [this repo](https://github.com/zonination/pokemon-chart/blob/master/chart.csv) referenced from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4sak8y/i_made_six_colorblindfriendly_versions_of_the/)
- data/evolve.csv is not intended to be complete. It is intended for a calculator to tell you how many Pokemon to sell before a evolving session. I got the data from the game and picked the Pokemon I've had in enough numbers to worry about how many to transfer for candy.
